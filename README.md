# longest-contiguous-increasing-range

Given a list of integers, return the index that denotes the longest contiguous increasing range. For example:

Given the list
1, 3, 5, -9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 78484348, 11, 12 ,13, 0, -1, 343, 1222, 0

The output should be:
(3, 8)

Because the zero-indexed list starts on the 3rd element and goes all the way to the 8th:
_ _ _ -9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 78484348 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
